\chapter{Design Project Planning} \label{AppendixC}
The execution of the research is planned to last 18 working weeks, November 24th - April 27th including 2 weeks vacations and 1 week of studying for a course. This time will be divided in three parts: Firstly the Problem Analysis, Literature study and Research Design will be performed. Secondly, the research execution is performed and a artifact will be designed. Lastly, the report will be finalized and a presentation is given about the project. The planning is shown in a Gantt Chart, depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Planning}, where the performed steps are deleted. During the execution of the project, adjustments can be made regarding the planning. Therefore, the planning will be updated for every hand-in moment and will be excluded in the final version.
