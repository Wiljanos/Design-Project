 abstract = {Some life tests result in few or no failures. In such cases, it is difficult to assess reliability with traditional life tests that record only time to failure. For some devices, it is possible to obtain degradation measurements over time, and these measurements may contain useful information about product reliability. Even with little or no censoring, there may be important practical advantages to analyzing degradation data. If failure is defined in terms of a specified level of degradation, a degradation model defines a particular time-to-failure distribution. Generally it is not possible to obtain a closed-form expression for this distribution. The purpose of this work is to develop statistical methods for using degradation measures to estimate a time-to-failure distribution for a broad class of degradation models. We use a nonlinear mixed-effects model and develop methods based on Monte Carlo simulation to obtain point estimates and confidence intervals for reliability assessment.},

Therefore the theory of variations is applicable. The importance of distinguishing the two kinds of variations, namely random system variations and assignable variations, in a robot calibration process is demonstrated through a Monte Carlo simulation.",

abstract="Prognostics and health management (PHM) technologies reduce time and costs for maintenance of products or processes through efficient and cost-effective diagnostic and prognostic activities. PHM systems use real-time and historical state information of subsystems and components to provide actionable information, enabling intelligent decision-making for improved performance, safety, reliability, and maintainability. However, PHM is still an emerging field, and much of the published work has been either too exploratory or too limited in scope. Future smart manufacturing systems will require PHM capabilities that overcome current challenges, while meeting future needs based on best practices, for implementation of diagnostics and prognostics. This paper reviews the challenges, needs, methods, and best practices for PHM within manufacturing systems. This includes PHM system development of numerous areas highlighted by diagnostics, prognostics, dependability analysis, data management, and business. Based on current capabilities, PHM systems are shown to benefit from open-system architectures, cost-benefit analyses, method verification and validation, and standards.",

Soft computing is a better alternate to predict and optimize the manufacturing processes related to physics-based models as these processes are complex and precarious. The theories of artificial neural systems, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization are utilized by soft computing techniques to handle real-world issues that cannot be palatably handled utilizing conventional computing methods.

abstract="Condition-based maintenance (CBM) is a decision-making strategy based on real-time diagnosis of impending failures and prognosis of future equipment health. It is a proactive process that requires the development of a predictive model that can trigger the alarm for corresponding maintenance. Prognostic methodologies for CBM have only recently been introduced into the technical literature and become such a focus in the field of maintenance research and development. There are many research and development on a variety of technologies and algorithms that can be regarded as the steps toward prognostic maintenance. They are needed in order to support decision making and manage operational reliability. In this paper, recent literature that focuses on the machine prognostics has been reviewed. Generally, prognostic models can be classified into four categories: physical model, knowledge-based model, data-driven model, and combination model. Various techniques and algorithms have been developed depending on what models they usually adopt. Based on the review of some typical approaches and new introduced methods, advantages and disadvantages of these methodologies are discussed. From the literature review, some increasing trends appeared in the research field of machine prognostics are summarized. Furthermore, the future research directions have been explored.",
