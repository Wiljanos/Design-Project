    abstract = { A reliable prognostic model is very useful for industries to forecast equipment behaviors. The aim of this research is to verify the effectiveness of the neuro-fuzzy model in predicting the health condition of bearings. Simulation and an experiment have been carried out to verify the model, with results showing that the neuro-fuzzy model is a reliable and robust forecasting tool, and more accurate than a radial basis function network. In the experiment, vibration data collected from the equipment is used to predict the future condition. }

Abstract = {Using a friendly, nontechnical approach, the Second Edition of Regression Basics introduces readers to the fundamentals of regression. Accessible to anyone with an introductory statistics background, this book builds from a simple two-variable model to a model of greater complexity. Author Leo H. Kahane weaves four engaging examples throughout the text to illustrate not only the techniques of regression but also how this empirical tool can be applied in creative ways to consider a broad array of topics.New to the Second Edition• Offers greater coverage of simple panel-data estimation: Because the availability of panel data has increased over the past decade, this new edition includes coverage of estimation with multiple cross-sections of data across time.• Provides an introductory discussion of omitted variables bias: As a problem that frequently arises, this issue is important for those new to regression analysis to understand.• Includes up-to-date advances: Chapter 7 is expanded to },

abstract="Due to high costs associated with conventional maintenance strategies, application of soft computing in monitoring the condition of equipment to predict the health of various components of machine tools in manufacturing processes has attracted the attention of researchers. Soft computing is a better alternate to predict and optimize the manufacturing processes related to physics-based models as these processes are complex and precarious. The theories of artificial neural systems, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization are utilized by soft computing techniques to handle real-world issues that cannot be palatably handled utilizing conventional computing methods. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review on the recent developments in the use of soft computing in condition-based maintenance in manufacturing.",

abstract="Condition-based maintenance (CBM) is a decision-making strategy based on real-time diagnosis of impending failures and prognosis of future equipment health. It is a proactive process that requires the development of a predictive model that can trigger the alarm for corresponding maintenance. Prognostic methodologies for CBM have only recently been introduced into the technical literature and become such a focus in the field of maintenance research and development. There are many research and development on a variety of technologies and algorithms that can be regarded as the steps toward prognostic maintenance. They are needed in order to support decision making and manage operational reliability. In this paper, recent literature that focuses on the machine prognostics has been reviewed. Generally, prognostic models can be classified into four categories: physical model, knowledge-based model, data-driven model, and combination model. Various techniques and algorithms have been developed depending on what models they usually adopt. Based on the review of some typical approaches and new introduced methods, advantages and disadvantages of these methodologies are discussed. From the literature review, some increasing trends appeared in the research field of machine prognostics are summarized. Furthermore, the future research directions have been explored.",
